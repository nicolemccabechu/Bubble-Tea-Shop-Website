# Commerce-Website
Website for a fictional shop using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. Website is fully responsive, mobile-friendly, and includes a working cart. This was the final project for the [UCD COMP20030 Web Design module](https://hub.ucd.ie/usis/!W_HU_MENU.P_PUBLISH?p_tag=MODULE&MODULE=COMP20030).

## Task
You are tasked with designing a food business website. This can be for a brick-and-mortar business (i.e. a sit-down location), for a catering organisation, a take-
away business, or some combination of the above. The design of this website should include promotional aspects (designed to attract new customers/members) and functional elements (designed for habitual use). You may design your website principally as a promotional or functional website. I received an A+ grade.
